c compiler - compiles a miniC program to PDL or to an SMV file
The files need to be in the sample/sample_c folder or a child folder
Usage: <input file> [-pdl <file>] [-smv <file>]
  -int <from> <to>  sets integer range
  -integer          sets int variables as integers (non-compatible with BDD)
  -pdl <file>       sets output file for PDL program
  -positive         uses only non-negative integer
  -smv <file>       sets output smv file
  -32b              sets integer size to 32 bits (default option)
  -64b              sets integer size to 64 bits
